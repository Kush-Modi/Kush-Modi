## About Me

I am an engineering student specializing in **Cybersecurity**, with strong interests in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI system design**.  
My focus is on building **robust, interpretable, and security-aware ML systems**, especially in environments where failures are costly.

I have completed **research internships at NIT Warangal and C-DAC Hyderabad**, working on:
- Machine learning for security and anomaly detection  
- Autonomous and intelligent systems  
- Practical ML pipelines deployed in constrained or high-risk environments  

I enjoy working at the intersection of **theory, implementation, and deployment** rather than toy projects.

---

## Core Interests

- AI Security and Adversarial ML  
- LLM reliability, RAG systems, and agent architectures  
- Malware analysis and automated threat detection  
- Blockchain systems for trust, integrity, and verification  
- Applied deep learning for real-world signals (vision, text, security logs)

---

## Skills & Tooling

**Languages**
- Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL  

**Machine Learning & AI**
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch  
- CNNs, classical ML models, feature engineering  
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines  
- Model evaluation, robustness testing, and failure analysis  

**Cybersecurity**
- Malware analysis fundamentals  
- Vulnerability analysis and secure system design  
- Web security, automation, and adversarial thinking  

**Systems & Web**
- React.js, Node.js, Express  
- Firebase, REST APIs  
- Blockchain basics (Ethereum / Polygon testnets)  

---

## Featured Projects

### Nomos – AI Legal Assistant
A production-style AI system designed for **reliable legal assistance**, not just raw LLM output.

**Key highlights**
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for grounded responses  
- Multi-agent reasoning where agents critique and refine answers  
- Final response selection based on consensus and confidence  

Live demo: https://nomosbot.netlify.app

### Other Notable Work

- **Blockchain-based Prescription & Medicine Verification System**  
  Secure prescription storage with on-chain hashes and QR-based verification to prevent counterfeit drugs.

- **Object & Anomaly Detection using YOLO-based Pipelines**  
  Real-time detection systems with dataset curation and performance tuning.

- **CAPTCHA Automation using CNN + Selenium**  
  End-to-end pipeline including preprocessing, model inference, and browser automation.
